> üëã This repository's maintainer is available to hire for Python/PySpark consulting projects. To get a cost estimate, send email to lallyelias87@gmail.com (for projects of any size or complexity).

## Requirements

- [Python 3.8+](https://www.python.org/)
- [pip 23.3+](https://github.com/pypa/pip)
- [pyarrow 14.0+](https://github.com/apache/arrow)
- [pandas 2.0+](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas)
- [pyspark 3.5+](https://github.com/apache/spark/tree/master/python)
- [spark-nlp 5.2.2+](https://github.com/JohnSnowLabs/spark-nlp)

## Usage

- Clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lykmapipo/Python-Spark-Log-Analysis.git
cd Python-Spark-Log-Analysis
```

- Install all dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- To `parse and prepare` raw log files, run:
```sh
python prepare.py
```

- To get `basic summary report` of structured logs, run:
```sh
python summarize.py
```

- To perform `word frequency analysis` on structured logs, run:
```sh
python count_words.py
```

## Data
- Check [data/raw](https://github.com/lykmapipo/Python-Spark-Log-Analysis/tree/main/data/raw) directory for all `raw logs` data. Each file is in `text format`, and each log entry is format as `[timestamp] level: message`.

- Check [data/interim/structured-logs](https://github.com/lykmapipo/Python-Spark-Log-Analysis/tree/main/data/interim/structured-logs) directory for `structured logs` data generated when run `prepare.py`. Each file is in `parquet format`, and each log entry follow below `spark` schema:
```sh
root
 |-- log_timestamp: timestamp (nullable = true)
 |-- log_level: string (nullable = true)
 |-- log_message: string (nullable = true)
 |-- log_length: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_year: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_month: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_day: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_hour: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_minute: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_second: integer (nullable = true)
 |-- log_message_length: integer (nullable = true)
```

- Check [summary report](https://github.com/lykmapipo/Python-Spark-Log-Analysis/blob/main/data/reports/summary_report.csv) generated when run `summarize.py`.

- Check [word frequency analysis report](https://github.com/lykmapipo/Python-Spark-Log-Analysis/blob/main/data/reports/word_count.csv) generated when run `count_words.py`.
